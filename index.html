When Carol is seen in CH4 it plays a song labeled in the ost merely as </span><span style=''><strong>“C.” </strong></span><span style=''>(Interestingly, the same label for Chara’s music in UT with many parallels)</span><span style=''><strong>

</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='padding-top: 12.0PT; padding-bottom: 12.0PT; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>I believe Susie’s role in the future will be to tempt Kris as her wish to keep the dark world alive gets stronger. In the dark world, Susie is satan, the great dragon and a king indirectly worshipped by all. But in the light world, she is ashamed of her tail and monster-like attributes. In fact, her storyline may be a reference to the </span><span style=''><strong>Land of Toys</strong></span><span style=''> in Pinocchio, where indulging too much leads to a disease </span><span style='color: #1155cc; '><a href="https://images2.imgbox.com/2e/5b/aWFx5u3P_o.jpg" style="color: #1155cc; ">transforming them into donkeys.</a></span><span style=''> (Aka an </span><span style=''><strong>ASS</strong></span><span style=''>) Perhaps that’s why Susie also wants to find homes for Darkners, as a reference to </span><span style=''><strong>Santa</strong></span><span style=''> being an anagram for Satan.</span><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='padding-top: 12.0PT; padding-bottom: 12.0PT; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><strong>The false prophet</strong></span><span style=''> is described as a </span><span style=''><strong>gentle lamb with two horns</strong></span><span style=''> and speaks like a dragon. Their goal is to create </span><span style=''><strong>false signs</strong></span><span style=''> to make people worship the Antichrist. The false prophet is also said to be able to make statues come to life. Ralsei seems hesitant to explain the true rules as to why darkners turn to stone. Most likely because he has something to do with it. His prophecy encourages </span><span style=''><strong>You</strong></span><span style=''> and Susie to challenge the </span><span style=''><strong>angel’s heaven</strong></span><span style=''> and seal the fountains. 
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='padding-top: 12.0PT; padding-bottom: 12.0PT; direction: ltr; '><span style=''><strong>The Holy Trinity</strong></span><span style=''>: CH4 we see Kris collaborating with Carol. Given their reluctance in the weird route, I believe this is likely against their </span><span style='color: #ff0000; '><strong>will</strong></span><span style=''>. The conversation between Suzie and Noelle even mention sometimes when Kris talks </span><span style=''><strong>it sounds like their voice is coming from a speaker.</strong></span><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='padding-top: 12.0PT; padding-bottom: 12.0PT; direction: ltr; '><img src="img/b35bcb914086b4e10ed86617032665a4b45e85da.png" style="width: 455.88599999999997px; height: 114.97125px; margin: 9.0PT 9.0PT 9.0PT 9.0PT; "><span style=''>

Carol is telling Kris to do unspeakable things to her own daughter. Given this chapter takes place in a church, I believe Carol’s Deltarune could be representing Kris as </span><span style=''><strong>the son</strong></span><span style=''>, and Noelle as </span><span style=''><strong>the Holy Spirit</strong></span><span style=''>. After all, Deltarune loves its trios right?“the Holy Spirit </span><span style=''><strong>proceeds</strong></span><span style=''> from the Father through the Son”In this case </span><span style=''><strong>the Father</strong></span><span style=''> would be Carol. Notice the word “proceeds?” Feels like we’ve seen that before…
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='padding-top: 12.0PT; padding-bottom: 12.0PT; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>The Son, The Father and The Holy Spirit are said to each have their </span><span style=''><strong>own will</strong></span><span style=''>, but all align with God. (</span><span style='color: #ff0000; '><strong>The Player’s will</strong></span><span style=''>). The Son (Kris), being a form made by god meant to walk among their own creations. 
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='padding-top: 12.0PT; padding-bottom: 12.0PT; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>If the player is meant to represent god, that would mean they are the center of the trinity.

God’s will is absolute, despite each part of the trinity having their own will. The end credits of CH4 see a narrator asking “How much longer is it now? </span><span style=''><strong>My Deltarune</strong></span><span style=''>.” I believe the narrator could be speaking to the symbol of their worship, </span><span style='color: #ff0000; '><strong>the player</strong></span><span style=''> aka God at the center of the holy trinity. The one whose actions decide everyone’s fate. The Deltarune is a holy script that describes the events you see, but one that can be changed or interpreted multiple ways.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='padding-top: 12.0PT; padding-bottom: 12.0PT; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>Since you are god, you can choose to ignore Kris’ will and continue down the weird route which Kris has repressed in their memories, perhaps with the hope you will never find them. Most likely Susie and Noelle will </span><span style=''><strong>both</strong></span><span style=''> become an </span><span style=''><strong>angel</strong></span><span style=''>, and a </span><span style=''><strong>dragon</strong></span><span style=''>. These events are heavily foreshadowed in many scenes:

</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='padding-top: 12.0PT; padding-bottom: 12.0PT; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>The description of the trefoil in game files reads as follows: “Covered in </span><span style=''><strong>green clovers</strong></span><span style=''> and rainbows.” While the Dark World text mentions “moss.” Implying the sacred moss you eat in the dark world could be clovers.
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='padding-top: 12.0PT; padding-bottom: 12.0PT; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>Funnily enough Noelle comments when you equip it saying “What do you mean </span><span style=''><strong>Unused</strong></span><span style=''>!?” At first glance this seems like a gag, but also references Noelle’s uncanny ability to break the 4th wall and glitch games. Noelle’s soul is </span><span style='color: #ff0000; '><strong>red</strong></span><span style=''> like yours. She too has the ability to peer into the boundaries of her reality. But could the word “</span><span style=''><strong>Unused</strong></span><span style=''>” be referring to something more?

Gerson may also be hinting at it in this dialogue:

</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='padding-top: 12.0PT; padding-bottom: 12.0PT; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>Given that Deltarune has multiple exe files and added the functionality to launch different executables in-game, this doesn’t seem too far off.

</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='padding-top: 12.0PT; padding-bottom: 12.0PT; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>December then will be what all the players imagine her to be, she is what the player feels December is to them.

The significance of 9 has some implications. Rudy is a reference to Rudolph, the 9th reindeer.

Toby even asks us whether the letter made us feel happy or sad. 
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='padding-top: 12.0PT; padding-bottom: 12.0PT; direction: ltr; '><span style=''>We can assume then that 9 may show up more.

The prophecy talks about three heroes but it seems clear that Susie isn’t one of them. What if it’s not a prophecy at all?

The one that Gerson asks you to deliver the letter to. The prophecy in CH4 could then refer to three </span><span style=''><strong>completely different heroes</strong></span><span style=''>. Such as adventures Gerson had in the past with Carol or Asgore. If Suzie or Noelle awaken then, the heroes meant to stop them aren’t who we think at all, but maybe Carol, Alvin and someone else.

</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='direction: ltr; '><span style=''>This seems to imply that Hope is associated with Light, while Dreams are associated with Dark, and the Dark World sort of corroborates this, while Gerson’s </span><span style=''><strong>white pen</strong></span><span style=''> of “Hope” seems to imply Hope </span><span style=''><strong>shelters</strong></span><span style=''> you from “</span><span style=''><em>the dark.” </em></span><span style=''>

</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='direction: ltr; '><span style=''>Given that the prophecy was found in the </span><span style=''><strong>church</strong></span><span style=''>, and knowing that Kris could not even change it with the shadow crystal, it might imply Father Alvin or Gerson wrote the prophecy too.

</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='direction: ltr; '><span style=''>Carol has pretty severe parallels to </span><span style=''><strong>Chara</strong></span><span style=''>. Both sharing a music theme named C, talking with </span><span style='color: #ff0000; '><strong>red text</strong></span><span style=''>, and being associated with violent / disturbing routes.

</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='direction: ltr; '><span style=''>The line </span><span style=''><strong>“Thank You.”</strong></span><span style=''> could be a reference to when Chara is revived in UT.

</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='direction: ltr; '><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='direction: ltr; '><span style=''>The screen then flashes </span><span style='color: #ff0000; '><strong>red</strong></span><span style=''> like when Chara is taking over the game, as if Carol is trying to help you revive them. There’s some pretty other striking parallels here. Monsters in UT say because of Chara “The Underground was full of </span><span style=''><strong>Hope</strong></span><span style=''>.” It also seems to be implied that Chara arrived at the end of 201X, aka </span><span style=''><strong>December</strong></span><span style=''>. Kris has also been referenced as trying to </span><span style=''><strong>summon a demon </strong></span><span style=''>and Chara is self-described as </span><span style=''><em><strong>“The demon that comes when people call its name.”</strong></em></span><img src="img/3ac0a5984ab4ccd07b76cc2766c18847d5042ca4.png" style="width: 623.8439999999999px; height: 66.64999999999999px; margin: 9.0PT 9.0PT 9.0PT 9.0PT; "><span style=''>
</span></p><p class="normal_text" style='direction: ltr; '><span style=''><strong>“Hope crossed heart”</strong></span><span style=''> then could mean something pretty sinister. Almost as if HOPE in DR could be interpreted as something else. (Hatred Of People Eternal?) Interesting to note that while Deltarune has many religious references, there are very few </span><span style=''><strong>“crosses.”</strong></span><span style=''> Which could mean X or </span><span style=''><strong>“White Eggs”</strong></span><span style=''> are sneaky euphemisms for the actual religious symbolism.
